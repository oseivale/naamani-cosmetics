    description: `We have made this cleansing oil with organic carrier oils high in essential fatty acids, oleic acids, and

      the favorite choice for massaging onto the skin while removing surface impurities. We have carefully
      selected a list of carrier oils that work synergistically to cleanse your skin by removing impurities on
      the skin surface, while absorbing into the skin to improve hydration.`,
